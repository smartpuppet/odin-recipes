        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 large eggs:</strong> This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li><strong>2 cups all-purpose flour:</strong> All-purpose flour adds gluten, wich gives the waffle structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li><strong>1 ¾ cups milk :</strong> Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>½ cup vegetable oil:</strong> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon white sugar</strong> A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li> 
            <li><strong>4 teaspoons baking powder:</strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture</li>
            <li><strong>¼ teaspoons salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
            <li><strong>½ teaspoons vanilla extract:</strong> A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>nonstick cooking spray</strong> You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
